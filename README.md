# Practicum-II

The layout of this rep is a work in progress
Currently contains all code used for tracing data/testing
As project continues to take shape folders may be renamed

## Python:
Contains a notebook where I'm experimenting with stripping valuable data from the raw XML.  The main purposes are twofold:
1. get "DTS:From" and "DTS:To" fields to capture complex behavior (seen in screenshots)
2. get GUIDs to filter main query (Filtered Results.sql) - this step may not be in final build.  I'm thinking of workarounds.

## Screenshots:
Contains two jpg.  One of raw XML and one of the behavior the XML captures that is displayed with VS gui
